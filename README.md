# HAQIR – Quantum Image Representation

This project implements a Hierarchical Adaptive Quantum Image Representation (HAQIR)
technique designed for efficient quantum image encoding under NISQ constraints.

## Features
- Classical image preprocessing
- FRQI baseline implementation
- Proposed HAQIR adaptive encoding
- Public web demo using Streamlit

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for 24×7 free public access.

## Note
Experiments are limited to small image sizes due to quantum simulator constraints.
